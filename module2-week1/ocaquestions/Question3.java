    C. Line 6 generates a compiler error.

    F. Line 9 generates a compiler error.
    G. The code compiles as is.

/*
* A compiles because short is an integral type.
B generates a compiler error because int is an integral type, but 1.2 is a floating-point type.
C compiles because it is assigned a String.
D and E do not compile because short and int are primitives. Primitives do not allow methods to be called on them.
F compiles because length() is defined on String class.
