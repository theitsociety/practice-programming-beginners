*   1. Which of the following are valid Java identifiers? (Choose all that apply)
        A. A$B - valid
        B. _helloWorld - valid
        C. true - invalid - reserved keyword
        D. java.lang - invalid
        E. Public - valid - case sensitive - public
        F. 1980_s - invalid
*

/*
*

    A is valid since dollar sign is valid identifiers.
    B is valid since an underscore is valid identifiers.
    C is not a valid identifier since true is a Java reserved word.
    D is not valid since . is not allowed in identifiers.
    E is valid because Java is case sensitive, so Public is not a reserved word.
    F is not valid because the first character is not a letter, $, or _.
