 Java types
    Primitive types vs Complex(reference) types

 Primitive types - 8 data types
    byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char
    Size ve data type hierarchy

 byte - 8
 short - 16
 int - 32
 long - 64

 float - 32
 double - 64

 boolean - 1 - true-false
 char - 16


 Good to know
    1.
    You can have underscores in numbers to make them easier to read:
         int million1 = 1000000;

         int million2 = 1_000_000;

    We’d rather be reading the latter one because the zeroes don’t run together. You can add
    underscores anywhere except at the beginning of a literal, the end of a literal, right before a
    decimal point, or right after a decimal point. Let’s look at a few examples:

     double notAtStart = _1000.00; // DOES NOT COMPILE
     double notAtEnd = 1000.00_; // DOES NOT COMPILE
     double notByDecimal = 1000_.00; // DOES NOT COMPILE
     double annoyingButLegal = 1_00_0.0_0; // this one compiles

     2.
     You do not have to know this for the exam, but the maximum number an int can hold is
             2,147,483,647.
     How do we know this? One way is to have Java tell us:

     System.out.println(Integer.MAX_VALUE);

     The other way is with math. An int is 32 bits. 232 is 4,294,967,296. Divide that by 2 and
     you get 2,147,483,648. Then subtract 1 as we did with bytes and you get 2,147,483,647. It’s
     easier to just ask Java to print the value, isn’t it?


 Common Errors
    - Case Sensitive

            double interestRate = 0.05;
            double interest = interestrate * 45;

    - overflow and underflow
